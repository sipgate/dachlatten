Shared Toolbox of battle-proven bits and pieces of code to help with wrangling Kotlin/Android code.

Think of it as the modern-day variant of Louis CAD's [Splitties Library][splitties] or [Apache Commons][commons] if that's your jam, just with Coroutines and Compose.

## Future plans and contributions

Currently there are no plans to support KMM, since we just don't have the need yet.

PRs are welcome on a case by case base, we can't promise they'll get merged though.

## On the name

The name is based off an in-joke that originated at [sipgate][sipgate], if you want in on it, feel free to [get in touch][jobs].

## On code maturity

While this library strives for correctness, it is still in its early stages. Stuff will break and until Kotlin 2 is
released this relies on pre-release libraries.
